# Each
#
# Displaying each of the student's name was kind of a pain, right? We had to know how big our array was, then display each item. If we had to add or remove a student, what would we have to do?
#
# We want to do the same thing with each name. Ruby offers us an easy way to do this, called `each`.
#
#
# Type
# names = ["Ian", "Fred", "Suma", "Ben", "Kyle", "Glenn"]
# names.each do |name|
#   puts name
# end
#
#
#
# Let's look into what's going on here.
#
# - We have a bunch of `names`
# - We put each name in variable, `name`
# - We then display the name
# - When we display the last name, we're done
#
# `each` is incredibly powerful and is part of Ruby's best features. So let's play with it some more.
#
#
#
# Exercise One
#
# Let's go back to our t-shirt example.
# You have three shirts
#   - New Shirt
#   - Howling Wolf
#   - Cool Band
#
# Display
#  "I'm wearing New Shirt"
#  "I'm wearing Howling Wolf"
#  "I'm wearing Cool Band"
#
# Hints
#   - Start off with
#     drawer = ["New Band", "Howling Wolf", "Cool Band"]
#   - Use `each`
#   - You can use `+` to stick two strings together
#
# Exercise Two
#
# Put all of our names in an array.
# Display each name in ALL CAPS
#
# Exercise Three
#
# Put all of our names in an array.
# Display each of our names.
# If you are displaying your name, display it in ALL CAPS
