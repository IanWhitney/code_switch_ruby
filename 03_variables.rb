# Variables

# Having to type out those names twice was kind of a pain, right? It would be great if we could save our name somewhere and just refer to it as many times as we need.
#
# Thankfully, computers are great at this.
#
# We can save something (numbers, strings, whatever) by giving it a name, called a 'variable'
#
# Type
# my_variable = 1
# puts my_variable
# puts my_variable
#
#

# Exercise
# Work with your pair to write out both of your names twice.
# So if I were doing it, the program would write out:
#   Ian Whitney
#   Ian Whitney
#

# In Ruby, variables can be changed.
# Type
# my_variable = 1
# puts my_variable
# my_variable = "Hello"
# puts my_variable
#
#
#
#
# You can also save the result of a caculation in a variable, and even do more calculations with it!
# Type
# my_variable = 5 * 10
# puts my_variable
# puts my_variable * 10
#
#
# Exercise
# Work with your pair to save one of your ages in a variable.
# Then display how many seconds old that person is.
# Be sure to use the variable!
