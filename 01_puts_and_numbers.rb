# Puts and Numbers

# In these early examples I'm going to tell you what code to type and then we will run the code you type and see what happens. You will probably get errors, that's fine and normal. Programmers get errors all the time. So if something isn't running for you and your pair, and you can't see why, just let a TA know and we'll try to help.
#

# Programming, like the rest of life, needs numbers.
# Type on a new line:
# puts 1 + 2


# Then click the button that says Run
#
# We can do more than addition. Try typing these
#
# puts 2 * 3

# puts 5 - 8

# puts 10 / 3

# puts 10.0 / 3.0

# And click Run when you're ready.
# Most of that probably looks like how you thought it would look. Except for the 3rd line. What is going on there?
#
# "But when you do arithmetic with integers, you'll get integer answers.
# When your computer can't get the "right" answer, it always rounds down."
# When you tell Ruby to use decimal places, it returns answers that use decimal places.
#
# Why do I keep typing puts?
# puts is a command in Ruby that displays the result on your screen. You will hear people pronounce this word as "puts", just like the word in English. You will also hear people say it as "Put s". Either way is fine.
#
#
# Work with your pair and try to write code that answers these questions.
#
# How many hours are in a year?

# How many minutes are in a decade?

# How many seconds old are you?

# If I am 1246 million seconds old, how old am I?
