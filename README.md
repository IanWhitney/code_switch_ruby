# Code Switch: Learn To Code

## Wrap Up

Almost everything we're doing today comes from Chris Pine's book _Learn to Program_. You can read it, for free, at [https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram). Or you can get it from [the library](https://apps.hclib.org/catalog/record.cfm?all=Learn%20To%20Program&row=2&id=5154062) or [buy a copy](https://pragprog.com/book/ltp2/learn-to-program).

## What's Next

I recommend reading all of _Learn To Program_, and doing the exercises. Once you're done with that, check out [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/1), a fun, guided introduction to more Ruby than we covered today.

The [CodeNewbie](http://www.codenewbie.org) group is a fantastic resource for new programmers. They have weekly Twitter conversations, online Slack conversations, a podcast and in-person meetups.

After that, there are a variety of places where you can take coding classes, or watch lessons, for free.

- https://www.udacity.com/courses/all
- https://www.lynda.com (free if you have a [Hennepin library card](http://www.hclib.org/browse/online-resources/online%20resources%20container/online%20resources/online-resources-k-n/lynda-com), a [St. Paul library card](http://www.sppl.org/lynda), or attend/work at the [University of Minnesota](http://it.umn.edu/lyndacom-online-courses-0))

If you're looking for programming problems to practice on, I recommend [http://exercism.io](http://exercism.io). It's a free source of programming problems in over 30 languages. Even better, you can get feedback on your solutions and see the solutions provided by other students, which is a fantastic way to learn.

I help run a [mentoring group for programmers at the University of Minnesota](http://umnhackerhours.github.io). It is open to everyone. You do not need to be a programmer, or a University employee. I'm almost always there and I'm happy to continue teaching what we worked on this weekend. You can reach me on Twitter [@iwhitney](https://twitter.com/iwhitney) or email, ian@ianwhitney.com
