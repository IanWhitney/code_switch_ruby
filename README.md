# Code Switch: Learn To Code

## Wrap Up

Almost everything we're doing today comes from Chris Pine's book _Learn to Program_ . You can read it, for free, at [https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram). Or you can get it from [the library](https://apps.hclib.org/catalog/record.cfm?all=Learn%20To%20Program&row=2&id=5154062) or [buy a copy](https://pragprog.com/book/ltp2/learn-to-program).

## What's Next

I recommend reading all of _Learn To Program_, and doing the exercises. Once you're done with that, check out [http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/1](Try Ruby), a fun, guided introduction to more Ruby than we covered today.

After that, there are a variety of places where you can take coding classes, or watch lessons, for free.

- https://www.udacity.com/courses/all
- https://www.lynda.com (free if you have a [Hennepin library card](http://www.hclib.org/browse/online-resources/online%20resources%20container/online%20resources/online-resources-k-n/lynda-com))

I help run a [mentoring group for programmers at the University of MN](http://umnhackerhours.github.io). It is open to everyone. You do not need to be a programmer, or a University employee. I'm almost always there and I'm happy to continue teaching what we worked on this weekend. Or you can reach me on Twitter [@iwhitney](https://twitter.com/iwhitney)
